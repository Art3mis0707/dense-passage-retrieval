Dense Passage Retriever is a Python library for efficient and accurate passage retrieval from large document collections using dense vector representations and approximate nearest neighbor search.

Features
Semantic Matching: Leverage pre-trained language models to encode queries and passages into dense vectors, enabling semantic understanding and matching beyond exact term matches.
Efficient Retrieval: Use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexing techniques like FAISS or ScaNN for fast and scalable retrieval from large document collections.
Flexible Pipeline: Modular design allows for easy customization and integration of different components, such as encoders, indexers, and rankers.
Multi-GPU Support: Leverage multiple GPUs for faster encoding and retrieval.
Evaluation Tools: Built-in tools for evaluating retrieval performance using standard metrics like Recall, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).
